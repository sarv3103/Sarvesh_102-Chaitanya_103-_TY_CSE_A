FIX LOGIN ISSUE - FOLLOW THESE STEPS
========================================

Your login is failing because the admin password
hash in the database is incorrect.

STEP 1: Diagnose the Problem
-----------------------------
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost/NOTICE_SCHEDULER/diagnose-login.php

This will show you EXACTLY what's wrong.

STEP 2: Fix the Password
-------------------------
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost/NOTICE_SCHEDULER/fix-admin-password.php

This will:
- Reset admin password to correct hash
- Set admin as verified and active
- Show you success message

STEP 3: Try Login Again
------------------------
Go to:
http://localhost/NOTICE_SCHEDULER

Login with:
Email: admin@noticeboard.com
Password: admin123

STEP 4: Clean Up (IMPORTANT!)
------------------------------
After successful login, DELETE these files:
- diagnose-login.php
- fix-admin-password.php
- test-connection.php
- setup-admin.php
- LOGIN_FIX_INSTRUCTIONS.txt

========================================
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
========================================

The password hash in the database doesn't match
the password you're entering. This can happen if:

1. Database was imported incorrectly
2. Password hash format is wrong
3. PHP version mismatch

The fix-admin-password.php script will create
a NEW correct hash using your server's PHP.

========================================
ALTERNATIVE: Manual Fix via phpMyAdmin
========================================

If the scripts don't work:

1. Go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin
2. Open database: notice_sender
3. Click on table: users
4. Find row with email: admin@noticeboard.com
5. Click "Edit"
6. In password_hash field, paste this:
   $2y$10$92IXUNpkjO0rOQ5byMi.Ye4oKoEa3Ro9llC/.og/at2.uheWG/igi
7. Set is_verified = 1
8. Set is_active = 1
9. Click "Go"
10. Try login again

========================================
STILL NOT WORKING?
========================================

1. Check XAMPP - MySQL must be running
2. Check database exists: notice_sender
3. Check browser console (F12) for errors
4. Clear browser cache and cookies
5. Try different browser
